                              -> Kyu ki dev server m databse change bhi ho skta h to us case m qa ko test run krne m issue aa skta h to hm qa server m bhi code dal dete h

    5. Test execution.  -> Test case ko execute krte h .

    6. Test closer activity ->
        1. Ensure test completion -> sare test case successfully execute hue ya ni .
        2. Handover test artifects -> client ko test report handover krnis
        3. Project Retrospective -> project m koi mistake to ni h , use discuss krna or next time kliye improve krna.
